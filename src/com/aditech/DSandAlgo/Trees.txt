What are trees?
-> Trees are the Special type of graphs. 

						A --- Root
		  	  Edges--- / \
					  B   C --- Node
					 / \
 		Leaf node---D   E --- Node
					   / 
					  F --- Leaf node
					  
Imagine it as a mirror image of actual tree. At top we have root and after 
that we have nodes and the node who does not have any child elements are
known as leaf nodes.
					  

Traversal on trees
	- Breadth first search
	- Depth first search


1. Breadth first search -> Level order
   This means traversing the node level by level fashion.
						A --- Level 1
					   / \
					  B   C --- Level 2
					 / \
					D   E --- Level 3
					   / 
					  F --- Level 4
 In this travesal we will visit and complete each level of the tree and 
 then will go to the next level.
  				  
2. Depth first search ->
	Preorder Traversal <Root><Left><Right>
	Inorder Traversal <Left><Root><Right>
	Postorder Traversal	<Left><Right><Root>
